## Testing

1. Install dev requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.dev`
2. Run tests using `py.test [optional/path/to/tests]`

You can also enable coverage reports when running tests by using ``--cov slashed/path`` option to specify a path to package report for which should be gathered, and ``--cov-report (html|xml|annotate)`` to specify type of coverage report you want to receive.

Use `-v` to make tests output more verbose.
